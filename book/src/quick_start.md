# Quick start

In order to run Sandhole, you'll need:

- A server with at least one public address.
- A domain (for example, `sandhole.com.br`), and its subdomains (`*.sandhole.com.br`), configured via DNS to point to the public address.

Then, install the Sandhole binary in your server. Currently, you can do so [through Docker Compose](./docker_compose.md), by downloading [a binary from the latest release](https://github.com/EpicEric/sandhole/releases/latest), or by [compiling it yourself](./compiling_from_source.md).

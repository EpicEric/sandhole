# sandhole

Experimental SSH hole-punching tunnel for exposing HTTP services.

## Status

This is not in a usable state, and mostly serves as an experiment. Contributions are welcome.

### TO-DO

Roughly in the order I intend to work on:

- Better terminal logging for client and server
- Domain authorization with DNS
- Testing
- ACME for certificates
- HTTPS redirection
- Alternate address assignment options
- Local port forwarding
- Generic TCP forwarding
- API-based password authentication
- And more
